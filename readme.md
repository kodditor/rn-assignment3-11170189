This assigment involved converting a figma design into a functioning Expo application.

We discovered the implementations of Flat lists, Text Inputs and Scroll Views, while implementing custom react native components composed of a myriad of view and text components.

### The Search Input Component
This custom component, implemented with Views, a Text Input, Icons, and a TouchableHighlight, simulated the search bar and filter sections of the app.

### The Categories Component
This component presented the various categoruies of tasks in a horizontal flatlist with corrensponding accent colours and images.

### The Tasks Component
This component displays all the current tasks, sorted by date, with their corresponding category

Here are a few screenshots of the application:
